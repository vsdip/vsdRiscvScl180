# RISC-V SoC Implementation using Synopsys and SCL180 PDK

## Overview
This repository contains a reference RISC-V SoC implementation with I/O interfaces from SCL (Semiconductor Laboratory), designed specifically for participants under the SMDP (Special Manpower Development Program). The RISC-V SoC implementation IP provided here serves as a reference design and is absolutely FREE to use for tapeout purposes with the SCL180 process. Access to this repository is restricted to individuals who have access to Synopsys tools and have signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL) to use their 180nm Process Design Kits (PDKs).

## Prerequisites
Before using this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **SCL180 PDK** ( SCL180 PDK)
- **RiscV32-uknown-elf.gcc** (building functional simulation files)
- **Caravel User Project Framework** from Efabless
- **Synopsys EDA tool Suite** for Synthesis
- **Verilog Simulator** (e.g., Icarus Verilog)
- **GTKWAVE** (used for visualizing testbench waves)

## Test Instructions
### Repo Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh 
   git clone https://github.com/vsdip/vsdRiscvScl180.git
   cd vsdRiscvScl180
   ```
2. Install required dependencies (ensure dc_shell and SCL180 PDK are properly set up).

### Functional Simulation Setup
3. Setup functional simulation file paths
   - Edit Makefile at this path [./dv/hkspi/Makefile](./dv/hkspi/Makefile)
   - Modify and verify `GCC_Path` to point to correct riscv installation
   - Modify and verify `scl_io_PATH` to point to correct io

###  Functional Simulation Execution
4. open a terminal and cd to the location of Makefile i.e. [./dv/hkspi](./dv/hkspi)
5. make sure hkspi.vvp file has been deleted from the hkspi folder
6. Run following command to generate vvp file for functional simulation
   ```
   make
   vvp hkspi.vvp
   ```
- you should receive output similar to following output on successfull execution
![functional simulation](./images/functional_simulation.png)
7. Visualize the Testbench waveforms for complete design using following command
   ```
   gtkwave hkspi.vcd hkspi_tb.v
   ```
   ![GTK WAVE](./images/gtkwave_FS.png)

### Synthesis Setup
8. Modify and verify following variables in synth.tcl file at path [./synthesis/synth.tcl](./synthesis/synth.tcl)
   ```
   library Path
   Root Directory Path
   SCL PDK Path
   SCL IO PATH

   ```
### Running Synthesis
9. open a terminal and cd to the work folder i.e. [./synthesis/work_folder](./synthesis/work_folder)
10. Run synthesis using following command
```
dc_shell -f ../synth.tcl
```
This should update the caravel_snthesis.v file in [./synthesis/output](./synthesis/output) folder
### GLS Setup
11. Modify and verify following variables in Makefile at path [./gls/Makefile](./gls/Makefile) according to your paths
```
SCL PDK Path
GCC Path
SCL IO Path
```

12. Modify synthesized netlist at path [./synthesis/output/vsdcaravel_synthsis.v](./synthesis/output/caravel_synthesis.v) to remove blackboxed modules
   - Remove following modules
   ```
   dummy_por
   RAM128
   housekeeping
   ```
   - add following lines at the beginning of the netlist file to import the blackboxed modules from functional rtl
   ```
   `include "dummy_por.v"
   `include "RAM128.v
   `include "housekeeping.v"
   ```
###  GLS Execution
13. open a terminal and cd to the location of Makefile i.e. [./gls](./gls)
14. Replace 1'b0 from vsdcaravel.v file with vssa.
15. make sure hkspi.vvp file has been deleted from the GLS folder
16. Run following command to generate vvp file for GLS
   ```
   make
   vvp hkspi.vvp
   ```
- you should receive output similar to following output on successfull execution
![GLS output](./images/gls.png)
17. Visualize the Testbench waveforms for complete design using following command
   ```
   gtkwave hkspi.vcd hkspi_tb.v
   ```
   ![GTK WAVE](./images/gtkwave_gls.png)
18. Compare output from functional Simulation and GLS to verify the synthesis output

    
## Results
- Successfully ran functional simulations, synthesis and GLS for VexRiscV Harnessed with Efabless's Caravel usign SCL180 PDK.

## Issues
- Housekeeping module has not synthesized successfully and was blackboxed for GLS purpose. 
- Por, RAM modules are blackboxed and will be replaced with macros in future

## Future Roadmap
- Resolve houskeeping issues
- Generate more testbench simulations based on VexRiscv internal function
- Complete PD flow for tapeout
